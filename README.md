# MRNet network

This repository contains an implementation of a convolutional neural network for knee injury classification from MRI exams.

## Dataset: MRNet 

The data comes from Stanford ML Group research lab. It consits of 1,370 knee MRI exams performed at Stanford University Medical Center to study the presence of Anterior Cruciate Ligament (ACL) tears.

For more information about the ACL tear problem and the MRNet data please refer to my blog post
